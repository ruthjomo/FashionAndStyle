            <p class="history">A call for Reform dress had begun in the mid 19th century, as men and women argued that the amount of women’s underclothing, the constrictive corset, and the sheer weight of women’s clothes were all harmful to women’s health.<br> 
            These health reformers sought alternatives to the constricting and uncomfortable fashionable styles in attempts to make fashion rational, hygienic and beautiful.<br>
            Like those reformers concerned with health, the aesthetic dress movement that began in England was concerned about the excessive weight of women’s clothing.<br>
            However, they also objected to the ornamentation of Victorian dress, favoring a simpler and cleaner line and decoration.<br>
            Aesthetic or artistic dress was sparked by influential artists and designers such as those of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a counterculture of artists and writers who viewed the rigid fashions of the day as artificial and unattractive.<br>
            These painters, including John Everett Mallais (1829-1896) and Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828-1882) painted women in clothing inspired by classical, Medieval and Renaissance styles.<br>
            These paintings increased the popularity of the style, at first within the art community, and then more widely.</p>

            <p class="history">The fashionable silhouette of the 1830s was created by a series of undergarments .<br>
                 In addition to the requisite long, tightly-laced corset, the giant leg-o-mutton sleeves also <br>
                 necessitated support to maintain their shape</p>
